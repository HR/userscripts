# My Userscript Collection

Requires you to have the browser extension for an _userscript manager_ (like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)) already installed.

## Amazon Invoice downloader

Shows a black "Download Invoices" button on each Amazon Orders page to allow you to download all the invoices on the page in bulk.

Currently only tested for Amazon.co.uk but may work for others if you change the Amazon domain in the script from Amazon.co.uk to Amazon.xxx (your regional Amazon domain)

Install by going to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HR/userscripts/master/amazon-uk-invoice-downloader.js
